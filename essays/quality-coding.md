As a person who had little to no knowledge on IDE's, the first week I spent with IntelliJ and ESLint has been a learning experience. I had touch IDE's before such as Visual Studio Code and Eclipse but I barely knew how the functions worked. My last semester had me code through terminal and text editors which was a severely painful experience. It hurts just thinking back about it. It wasn't easy and in order to move smoothly to edit your code, you would have to memorize a hundred key commands (or that's why I thought). However, going through practice problems everyday using IntelliJ and have ESLint by my side has been so much easier. Everyday, I learn something new on this platform.

ESLint is a little bit tricky of course. I remember my first time coding with the editor enabled, it gave me a whole page of red warnings. They seemed to be a bit angry with me. I spent some time adjusting to the coding standards and found the red warnings to be quite helpful. Of course getting an error for not putting a space in a certain place can be a bit annoying but it makes your code clean. The green check mark you get after completion always provides a little bit of serotonin.

I look forward to continue using this IDE for current and future projects. It's ability to work on html and JavaScript code side by side, immediately preview your work in a browser window of your choosing, and the degree of customization is a win for me.
