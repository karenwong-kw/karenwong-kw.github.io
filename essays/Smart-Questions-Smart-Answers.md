## What the heck is a "smart" question?

Everyone in their lifetime has gotten stuck on a problem. Unable to find a solution by ourselves, the only other option is to ask other people for help. Sometimes, this process becomes frustrating when even other people are unable to solve the issue. Time goes by as you are communicating back and forth and finally a solution! But after all of that frustration and work on both ends, it came down to a misunderstanding. They weren't able to understand the problem fully until the very end. All of this could have been avoided if the question being asked in the first place was a smart question. Eric Steven Raymond provides an enlighting input on how to ask questions the smart way. In his essay, he provides guidelines on how to accomplish this to solve problems you may have with programming. Asking questions the smart way shows that you took the time and effort into thinking this through. It shows you aren't wasting people's time and you've exhausted all the resources availble to you.
