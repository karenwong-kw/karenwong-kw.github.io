In fashion design, sewing patterns are shared, sold, and made as templates for people to create their own unique clothing peices. Most often patterns are cardboard cutouts meant to be traced onto the piece of cloth so that the designer has the basic shape and size to work with.

Take a look at this basic pattern. This common form of stitching and placement can create various designs. The sleeves are all different but the base of the top has the same form and fit. This outline is reusable to fit different types of styles and sizes. Just like in software programming, design patterns can act as sewing patterns. Design pattens are reusable solutions to common problems you may face in programming. Reusability is an important asset when coding. Code that can be easily learned, picked up, and used for future programs is sought after. And just like sewing patterns, you can't just cut out and stitch the cloth pieces together. You need to cut, press, and hem in order to get the final fashion piece. Design patterns are not just straight code you can copy and paste to fix your programming problems. It is used as a description or template of a potential solution.
