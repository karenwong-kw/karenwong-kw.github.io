The ITS Help Desk provides an array of services assisting users with problems they may face regarding UH owned services and devices. We help users that come in with hardware, data, software, or security issues. The most common work issues that are faced are helping users manage their UH account or troubleshoot Laulima.

I am currently employed at ITS Help Desk as an "Information and Technology Student Assistant". My work there mainly consists of assisting users with problems through our phoneline or e-mails. We currently work with a system called "Cherwell" which manages the incoming requests. Cherwell systems will create tickets for us to debrief and work on. This requires me to work not only with what I know but what my coworkers and supervisors know so we can solve the problem the best we can. This work consists of a lot of team work and communication with each other. Because we are often times working with private and critical information, there is a lot of security involved. We work with different departments and higher level managment to find a solution.
