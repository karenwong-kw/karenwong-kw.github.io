This project was an imitation of a bank database records and its user interface. Using C/C++ code, this program was able to add, delete, print, find, and order the "bank" records. Records are saved and written onto a txt file so the user is able to log out and still have the records be saved. The user is able to access the records through terminal. Records are automatically sorted when any changes are done to them. 

This project helped me get a better grasp and understanding on how C/C++ and Java are all connected. Throughout this project I saw how languages interact and share similarities. It also helped me learn a lot on command lines and how terminal works. This experience was helpful in learning how to deal with I/O interface and debugging any sort of issues the user may encounter. 

Source code to be made available soon
