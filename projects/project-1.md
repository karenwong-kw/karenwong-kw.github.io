Homebound is a story text-based adventure game my classmate and I developed using Java and EZ Graphics (http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/). Your consequences and choices hold heavy value. You will meet an array of characters with their own unique stories and go on to encounter mini games and puzzles along the way. The goal is to learn and ultimately choose what home means to you.

To give you a feeling of the game, here is an excerpt from the introduction:

<hr>

<pre>
It's different for everyone
but the feeling is the same

There's a time when everyone must leave home
What's your reason?

Our home is dying 
and our fate lies in the hands 
of five unlikely heros..
